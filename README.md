**DSN POWERBI HACKATHON BY OLAMILEKAN OMOTOSHO**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of tax awareness and payment behaviors in Nigeria. It derives its findings from a survey of over 16,000 individuals spanning all Nigerian states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

## Introduction

The main goal of this project was to derive insights into:
1. The level of tax awareness among respondents.
2. The factors influencing tax payment behavior.

### Data Collection
The data was gathered from a survey overseen by 57 supervisors across 1185 localities in 37 Nigerian states. The data was initially captured in Excel format and was later analyzed using PowerBI. Power Query Editor in PowerBI was crucial for data cleaning and visualization.

### Data Cleaning
To ensure high-quality and reliable data:
- Irrelevant columns were dropped.
- Adjusted data types where necessary.
- Conducted data profiling to understand value distributions.
- Addressed missing values and corrected discrepancies.

## Analysis

The dataset incorporated responses from:
- A balanced gender distribution.
- A religious breakdown of 58% Christian and 42% Muslim.
- A majority (70%) living in urban areas.
- About 47% being the primary breadwinners in their families.
- Majority of respondents (over 50%) are married with a single spouse.
- Most respondents (over 5000) are aged between 25-31.
- A significant portion reported a standard of living that was either "Very bad" or "Neither good nor bad".

### Tax Payment Awareness

There's a noticeable trend when it comes to awareness and payment of taxes:
- Over 50% of participants were unaware of Personal Income Tax.
- Of those unaware of Personal Income Tax, only a small fraction (0.8k of 8.8k) actually paid it.
- A similar trend was observed with Property Tax.

### Reasons for Non-payment of Taxes

The top reasons respondents gave for not paying taxes include:
1. Dissatisfaction with government services.
2. Prohibitive tax rates.
3. Perception of an unjust tax system leading to tax evasion.

### Willingness to Pay Taxes

There seems to be a relationship between the ease of accessing tax information and willingness to pay. Few found it easy to get tax information. However, a significant portion indicated they would be willing to pay taxes if there was a notable improvement in government services.

## Recommendations

To increase tax awareness and improve tax payment habits in Nigeria:
1. **Enhanced Awareness Campaigns**: Launch comprehensive campaigns to inform the populace about various tax forms and make the tax payment process more intuitive.
2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Develop transparent systems to show how tax revenues are used, which can help build trust.
3. **Accountability Measures**: Establish measures to hold offices accountable for the tax revenues they amass and ensure funds are used correctly.
4. **Improved Public Services**: Better public service quality can motivate citizens to pay their taxes.
5. **Tax Reduction Considerations**: Consider reducing taxes in specific areas to lessen the burden on citizens while still securing revenue for public services.

## Conclusion

This project offers critical insights into the tax behaviors of Nigerians. With the suggested strategies, the government can cultivate a culture of compliance, improve tax collection, and provide superior public services to its populace. The combination of increasing awareness, ensuring transparency, and addressing the concerns of citizens is vital for success.
